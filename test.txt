Action: Diagnosed Server/DB Mismatch & Employee List Issue
Result:
1. Schema Mismatch:
   - `AppSettings` and `SmtpConfig` had mismatched columns/identity rules.
   - Fixed via `script_additions.sql` and `server.py` updates (TOP 1 logic).
   - Confirmed API endpoints `/app/settings`, `/smtp/config` now return 200 OK.

2. Employee List Issue:
   - User reported empty list and 500 errors.
   - Diagnosis revealed a "Zombie" server process (old version) was running.
   - Action: Killed all python processes, rebuilt `payroll_api.exe`.
   - Verification: `check_client_specific.py` confirmed valid Employee data response for "(주)국민테크".

Status: RESOLVED.
Next: User to run `dist/payroll_api.exe`.
